# Optical Character Recognition
This repository aims to provide a collection of mini-projects for a beginner learning Optical Character recognition (OCR) using Deep Learning. Idea is to start with very simple idea for OCR and then progressing toward complex one. 

Current following ideas have been added:
* Training a custom CNN end-to-end for random string recognition
* Reading paragraph from a screenshot. Using OpenCV to segment out the characters and a custom CNN to classify charaters. 

I hope in future I get to do more mini-project to add progress toward more complex ideas.
